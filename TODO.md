LAMMPS-GUI TODO list:

# New feature ideas

## Implement data file manager GUI with the following features:
  - import coordinates and topology via VMD molfile plugins
  - import coordinates and topology from intermol
  - import coordinates and topology from OpenBabel
  - store data internally in a generalized YAML format
  - add/remove columns to per-atom data
  - change atom style for export to data file
  - merge one system to another
  - edit mapping between numeric and symbolic types. create labelmaps.
  - import/export LAMMPS data and molecule files
  - store coordinates internally as unwrapped coordinates
  - recenter coordinates
  - edit box boundaries
  - readjust box to extent of atoms (with or without estimated radius)
  - call to LAMMPS to create geometries from lattices (with/without molecule files) and STL files
  - call to LAMMPS to generate visualizations of geometries
  - edit force field parameters, e.g. apply charmm
  - edit / manage labelmap

## Write "wizard" dialogs for bootstrapping simulations
  this could be used for beginners to create an input file template for
  a few typical use scenarios (could perhaps use some LLM based KI to
  look up suggestions for answers?).
